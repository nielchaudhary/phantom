## üîí Project Overview

This project provides an anonymous chat application where user privacy is paramount. Leveraging the power of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), we ensure that both your identity and the content of your messages remain completely private. We cannot see who you are or what you say.

This application aims to provide a secure and private communication channel for individuals who value their anonymity.

## üöÄ Technology Stack

This project is built using modern web technologies to deliver a fast, robust, and scalable application:

- **React**: A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite**: A next-generation frontend tooling that provides an extremely fast development experience and optimized build process
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, improving code quality, readability, and maintainability

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- **npm** or **Yarn**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Project

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will typically start the application on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **üïµÔ∏è Complete Anonymity**: Your identity is protected using zero-knowledge proofs
- **üîê Message Privacy**: Chat content is secured and unreadable by the platform
- **‚ö° Real-time Communication**: Engage in live conversations without compromising privacy
- **üõ°Ô∏è Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Built on cryptographic principles that ensure true privacy

## üß† Zero-Knowledge Proofs Explained

Zero-knowledge proofs are a cryptographic method by which one party (the "prover") can prove to another party (the "verifier") that a given statement is true, without conveying any information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true. 

In this project, ZKPs are fundamental to ensuring that users can authenticate and interact without revealing their true identity or message content to the server or other parties.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- [ ] Group chat functionality
- [ ] File sharing with privacy preservation
- [ ] Voice message support
- [ ] Enhanced encryption algorithms
- [ ] Mobile application development
- [ ] Integration with additional ZKP libraries
